# Multivariate-Calculus
This is the note taken by Yuxin Gong, second-year Math student at Imperial College London. It is intended for a good summary of this course. There might be typos, incorrect places in this note since it is completely typed by myself in Latex and any mistakes are made by myself, irrelevant of what is being taught in the lectures. Finally, if any error appears, contact me at: [yg2523@ic.ac.uk](yg2523@ic.ac.uk).
